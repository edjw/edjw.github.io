I was recently in a Sacred Harp singing school where a new singer asked about female composers in the Sacred Harp. I said something like, "Oh yeah there are lots of great songs in here by women." A few days later I thought about the question for a bit and realised I had no idea what I was basing that answer on other than that I like a few songs that I knew were by women.

I've looked at the Sacred Harp and the minutes data to answer some questions about female composers in the Sacred Harp.

1. Who are the female composers in the book?
1. Which songs in the book are by female composers?
1. What proportion of songs in the book are by female composers?
1. What proportion of the composers in the book are female?
1. How likely are female composers to have multiple songs in the book?
1. How popular are the songs by female composers?
1. Has the popularity of songs by female composers changed over time?
1. What are the most popular songs by female composers?

There's a note at the bottom of this post about how I attributed gender to the composers. The short version is that I used the name given in the book for the composer and didn't get into nuances.

The data I created and used for this is available as a CSV spreadsheet here.

## Who are the female composers in the book? Which songs in the book are by female composers?

In many ways, this is the most interesting question. Here's a list of songs in the book by female composers!

26 Samaria – Maggie Denson Cagle – The first song in the book is by a woman!

77b Holcombe – Charlene Wallace

112 The Last Words of Copernicus – Sarah Lancaster

128 The Promised Land – M. Durham

275b Roll On – Cynthia Bass

345b I’m On My Journey Home – Sarah Lancaster

348t Ainslie – Judy Hauff

367 Consolation – Annie Denson Aaron

368 Stony Point – Judy Hauff

374 Oh, Sing With Me! – P. R. Lancaster

406 New Harmony – M. L. A. Lancaster

426t Kelley – Amanda Burdette Denson

446 Infinite Day – Ruth Denson Edwards

460 Sardis – Sarah Lancaster

465 Where There’s No Trouble and Sorrow – 
Doris W. DeLong

466 Haynes Creek – Joyce Harrison

491 Oh, What Love – Eula Denson Johnson

504 Wood Street – Judy Hauff

534 New Georgia – Ruth Denson Edwards

543 Thou Art God – Ruth Denson Edwards

545 The Pilgrim’s Way – Irene Parker Denson

547 Granville – Judy Hauff

551 Jacob’s Vision – Margaret Wright

## What proportion of songs in the book are by female composers?

4.15% (23) of songs in the book are by female composers. 84.5% (468) of songs are by male composers. 11.2% (62) of songs are by composers of unknown gender.

## What proportion of the composers in the book are female?

6.25% (16) of the named composers in the book are female. 93.75% (192) of the named composers are male. I didn't count songs in the book where I couldn't attribute a gender to the composer for this. 

## How likely are female composers to have multiple songs in the book?

Getting useful averages on how many songs female and male composer have in the book was really hard as the data is really skewed. Small numbers of men and women have a lot more songs than all the other composers of their gender.

This is the best way I could find of describing the data.

19% (3) of female composers and 36% (69) of male composers individually have more than 1 song in the book.

## How popular are the songs by female composers?

I used the data from minuted Sacred Harp singings from 1995-2017 to work out how many times each song by a female composer has been called as a proportion of all the songs called.

If all 554 songs in the book were led equally, 4.15% of all songs led in minuted singings would be by female composers. 4.17% of all songs led in minuted singings from 1995-2017 were by female composers.

## Has the popularity of songs by female composers changed over time?

Songs by female composers have become more popular since 1995. Every year since 2013 has beaten the previous record for popularity of songs by female composers.

## What are the most popular songs by female composers?

If all 554 songs in the book were led equally, each song would be led 0.18% of the time. Eight of the 23 songs in the book by female composers are more popular than that.

Here are the songs by female composers in order of most to least popular. (By comparison, 146 Hallelujah – the song in the book that's most often led – accounts for 0.8% of all songs led 1995-2017.)

112 The Last Words of Copernicus – Sarah Lancaster (1869) – 0.56%

26 Samaria – Maggie Denson Cagle (1936) – 0.52%

460 Sardis – Sarah Lancaster (1869) – 0.43%

128 The Promised Land – M. Durham (1835) – 0.34%

504 Wood Street – Judy Hauff (1986) – 0.34%

547 Granville – Judy Hauff (1986) – 0.29%

551 Jacob’s Vision – Margaret Wright (1959) – 0.27%

426t Kelley – Amanda Burdette Denson (1908) – 0.20%

77b Holcombe – Charlene Wallace (1986) – 0.16%

345b I’m On My Journey Home – Sarah Lancaster (1859) – 0.12%

406 New Harmony – M. L. A. Lancaster (1859) – 0.12%

275b Roll On – Cynthia Bass (1850) – 0.11%

543 Thou Art God – Ruth Denson Edwards (1959) – 0.09%

446 Infinite Day – Ruth Denson Edwards (1936) – 0.09%

368 Stony Point – Judy Hauff (1990) – 0.09%

534 New Georgia – Ruth Denson Edwards (1959) – 0.07%

348t Ainslie – Judy Hauff (1988) – 0.07%

466 Haynes Creek – Joyce Harrison (1988) – 0.07%

491 Oh, What Love – Eula Denson Johnson (1960) – 0.07%

374 Oh, Sing With Me! – P. R. Lancaster (1859) – 0.04%

367 Consolation – Annie Denson Aaron (1935) – 0.04%

465 Where There’s No Trouble and Sorrow – 
Doris W. DeLong (1960) – 0.02%


## How I attributed gender to composers

I used the composer names as given in the book to attribute gender. In general, if Wikipedia says a given name is predominantly used for men then I assumed a composer with that name was male.

There *are* songs in the book where the name given for the composer is not who wrote the song. There would be arguments for assigning the song to the original composer rather than the attributed composer but I decided not to get into that.

A song which is attributed in the book to a male composer is counted as being by a male composer even if it was written by a woman. A song which is attributed to a female composer is counted as being by a female composer even if it was written by a man. 

Songs where there is no clear composer are counted as unknown, neither male nor female. This includes songs where: a) only a surname is given (410t The Dying Californian – Ball), b) a songbook is given as the source of the tune (28t Aylesbury – A Book of Psalmody), and c) no source is given (43 Primrose Hill). I haven't delved into the sources of those tunes but it is very likely that the overwhelming majority of songs in these three groups were written by men.

Many of the composers in the book use their initials instead of their first name. I assumed that they were male unless I found out that they were female. (M. Durham, P. R. Lancaster, and M. L. A. Lancaster are female composers.) It seems particularly likely that I've made a mistake somewhere because of this assumption.

Finally, I have doubtless made mistakes in assigning a gender to some of the composers even considering the process above. The data I used is available here as a CSV spreadsheet. Let me know if you see any mistakes.
