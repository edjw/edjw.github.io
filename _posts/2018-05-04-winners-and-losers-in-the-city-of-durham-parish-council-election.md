Yesterday saw the first [City of Durham Parish Council Election](https://www.durham.gov.uk/durhamcityelection). Considering it was the first election of its type, it would have been handy if the council had told people how the electoral system would work.

The [parish council is divided into three wards](https://www.durham.gov.uk/media/24199/Community-Governance-Review-City-of-Durham-Parish-Boundary-and-Wards/pdf/CityOfDurhamParishBoundaryAndWards2017.pdf):

* Elvet and Gilesgate (six councillors)
* Neville's Cross (eight councillors)
* Durham South (one councillor)

Nearly all the candidates stood for a party but you voted for the candidates rather than the party. If you live in a ward with six councillors, you can vote for up to six candidates and the six candidates with the most votes win. It's [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) in a multi-member constituency.

The quirks of the system are clearest in the Neville's Cross ward.

Three Green candidates in Neville's Cross got more votes than the average Labour candidate got but only one Green candidate was elected.

One Lib Dem candidate got more votes than the average Labour and Green candidate but didn't get elected even though Labour and the Greens won two seats and one seat respectively.

It's important to note that two Labour candidates got significantly more support than the other Labour candidates.

It looks like Green voters ran out of Green candidates to vote for. With their remaining votes it looks likely that they voted for Labour candidates with the effect of boosting Labour candidates above Green candidates.
