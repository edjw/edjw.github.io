title: Making it easy to get thumbnails of YouTube videos

---
I made a web app that makes it easy to download thumbnails for YouTube videos. Itâ€™s called [Get YouTube Thumbnails](https://youtubethumbnails.pythonanywhere.com).

When you submit a YouTube URL, you get back the image, a link to that image, and the original height and width of that image (even if it's scaled down on your screen size). 

You can also download the image with a YouTube play logo overlaid on the top.

This is useful when you want to link to a YouTube video and you can't or don't want to embed a video. This might be:

* in emails
* in presentation slides (PowerPoint etc)
* in websites where you don't want any Javascript
* in websites where you want to minimise data transfers

Let me know if you find it useful!
