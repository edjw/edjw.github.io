Donald Trump says that removing statues to Confederate generals is "<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/15/full-text-trump-comments-white-supremacists-alt-left-transcript-241662" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable="1">changing history</a>".

He's wrong.

You don't need statues of the leaders of the Confederacy to remember what happened in America's history.

You can have memorials to victims of slavery and those who died in the Civil War instead.

Take Germany. They don't need statues of Hitler even though Hitler is part of German history.

They have memorials to the victims of Nazi Germany.

People in Germany remember Germany's history without having monuments to the people responsible for the Holocaust.
