Yesterday saw the first [City of Durham Parish Council Election](https://www.durham.gov.uk/durhamcityelection). Considering it was the first election of its type, it would have been handy if the council had told people how the electoral system would work.

The [parish council is divided into three wards](https://www.durham.gov.uk/media/24199/Community-Governance-Review-City-of-Durham-Parish-Boundary-and-Wards/pdf/CityOfDurhamParishBoundaryAndWards2017.pdf):

* Elvet and Gilesgate (six councillors)
* Neville's Cross (eight councillors)
* Durham South (one councillor)

Nearly all the candidates stood for a party but you voted for the candidates rather than the party. If you live in a ward with six councillors, you can vote for up to six candidates and the six candidates with the most votes win. It's [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) in a multi-member constituency.
